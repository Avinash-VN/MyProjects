# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Predictive Models

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset consists of anonymized transaction data, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Various predictive models are implemented and evaluated to enhance fraud detection accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling imbalanced datasets, feature scaling, and transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and distributions of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Training**: Implementing multiple machine learning models for fraud detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning Models & Evaluation)
- **Imbalanced-learn** (Handling Imbalanced Datasets)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
