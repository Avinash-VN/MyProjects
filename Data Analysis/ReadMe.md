# Toyota Corolla Price Trend Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the cost trend of Toyota Corolla over the years and predict future prices using various machine learning models. The models used for prediction include Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree. By leveraging these models, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis and accurate price predictions for Toyota Corolla vehicles.

## Features

### Data Collection
- Collect historical price data of Toyota Corolla from various sources.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Data Analysis
- Analyze the historical price trend of Toyota Corolla.
- Visualize the data to identify patterns and insights.

### Price Prediction Models
1. **Linear Regression**
   - A simple yet powerful model to predict future prices based on historical data.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A non-parametric method used for regression that predicts the price based on the k-nearest data points.

3. **Random Forest**
   - An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees and outputting the mean prediction.

4. **Decision Tree**
   - A model that predicts the target value by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Compare the models to determine the best predictor for Toyota Corolla prices.

## Results

The project includes detailed analysis and comparison of the performance of each model. The results are documented in the evaluation notebook, highlighting the best performing model for predicting the future prices of Toyota Corolla.
