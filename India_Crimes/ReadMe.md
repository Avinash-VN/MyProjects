# Crime Trends Analysis in India

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze crime trends in India, focusing on different states and specific types of crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and juvenile crime. The analysis also considers the total population of India to provide context and comparative insights. The dashboard was created using Tableau, and all the relevant files and links to the datasets are included in the accompanying deck. The deck also contains all the charts generated during the analysis.
