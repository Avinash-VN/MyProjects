# Sales Forecasting Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on sales forecasting using a sample dataset. The project involves data processing and analysis using Oracle Autonomous Database and Talend, followed by creating an interactive dashboard in Power BI. The Power BI file included in the folder contains the dashboards and analysis results, providing comprehensive insights into the sales trends and forecasts.

## Features

### Data Processing

1. **Oracle Autonomous Database**
   - Utilized for storing and managing the sales data.
   - Performed initial data loading and basic preprocessing tasks.

2. **Talend**
   - Used for advanced data processing and transformation.
   - Extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) processes to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

1. **Power BI**
   - Created interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends and forecasts.
   - Utilized various charts and graphs to present the data insights effectively.
   - Included filters and slicers for dynamic data exploration.

## Data Sources

## Results

The project delivers a detailed analysis of sales data, highlighting:
- Historical sales trends and patterns.
- Forecasted sales figures for future periods.
- Key insights and metrics to support business decision-making.

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive platform for exploring these insights, with various visualizations to help understand the data.

## Usage

1. **Data Processing with Oracle Autonomous Database and Talend**
   - Load the sample dataset into the Oracle Autonomous Database.
   - Use Talend to perform ETL operations, transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Visualization with Power BI**
   - Open the Power BI file located in the `/Sales_Forecast` folder.
   - Explore the dashboards to gain insights into the sales data and forecasts.
